# Phase 3: DI-Based Service Wiring + Flask Setup (RF011)

## ðŸ”Œ What You're Doing

You're now **"wiring"** your Flask application to use the database repository instead of file storage. This is called **dependency injection** - you're telling your app which storage system to use without changing any of your route logic.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Change

### **Before (Sprint 3)**:
```python
service = TaskService(task_storage)  # File-based storage
```

### **After (Sprint 4)**:
```python
repo = DatabaseTaskRepository(Session)  # Database storage
service = TaskService(repo)
```

## ðŸš€ Result

- âœ… Same API endpoints (`/api/tasks`, etc.)
- âœ… Same functionality and user interface  
- âœ… Professional database storage instead of JSON files
- âœ… All existing tests continue to work

**Ready to flip the switch from files to database!** ðŸ”„
